# CYBERPINK © 

#### CYBERPINK is a style based on cyberpunk culture. It was created thinking about the best adaptation to users who suffer from light sensitivity or photophobia, so that this is possible, dark colors and neon colors are used, 100% free from yellow light.

## Bracket Pair Colorization

##### As of VS Code update 1.67.0 there was a change in the pairs of brackets which standardize their colors. For a full CYBERPINK theme experience we recommend that you configure your _settings.json_ with the following code:

 _"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,_
 _"workbench.colorCustomizations": {_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground1": "#ff007b",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground2": "#7e0eff",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground3": "#008cff",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground4": "#ff63ae",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground5": "#b574ff",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.foreground6": "#45abff",_
 _"editorBracketHighlight.unexpectedBracket.foreground":"#ffffff",_
 _},_
